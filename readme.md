### How to add a new chart or graph

Adding a new chart or graph to the library requires multiple steps:
* Add the code for the graph to `./src/Components/Elements/Graphs/` folder
* Once the code is done add the id of the graph to either `GraphTypeForGriddedGraph` or `GeoHubGraphType` in `./src/Types.tsx` depending if you want it to be available in `GriddedGraphDashboard` or not
* Add the missing settings  to `GraphSettingsDataType` in `./src/Types.tsx`
* Add the graph configuration settings in `./src/Utils/transformData/graphConfig.ts`
* Add the graph to the list in `./src/Utils/getGraphList.tsx`
* Add the data schema for the graph and graph settings schema to the `./src/Schemas/schemaList.tsx`. Also add the graph to the `getGraphConfigChartConfigIdEnum` variable in the same file.
* Also add the missing properties to the `SettingSchema` in `./src/Schemas/schemaList.tsx`
* Add the data schema and settings schema to the `getDataSchema` and `getSettingsSchema` functions in `./src/Schemas/getSchema.tsx`
* Add the graph to the `graphComponent` and `getGraphProps` functions in `./src/Components/Dashboard/GraphEl.tsx`
* Finally add an export in `./src/index.ts`

Adding documentation and stories in storybook:
* Add a new story in `./src/stories/Graph+Map+Chart` folder
* Add a graph name and id to `GraphNames` in `./src/stories/assets/constants.ts`
* Add a config file for the graph in `./src/stories/assets/config` folder
* Add the graph in `./src/stories/assets/graphSettingsSelect.ts`
* Add the graph in `./src/stories/assets/graphDataConfigSelect.ts`
